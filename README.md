Wildlife-WebGIS
Overview

Wildlife-WebGIS is a web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) application designed to visualize and track wildlife movement and habitat data. This application allows users to interact with geospatial data related to wildlife tracking, including the ability to view specific routes and locations on a dynamic map interface using Leaflet.
Features

    Wildlife Movement Visualization: Display the routes and locations of tracked wildlife using geospatial data.
    Interactive Map: Users can click on wildlife markers to view detailed information about specific animals, including their movement patterns and habitat.
    Custom Basemaps: The map interface includes multiple basemap options (e.g., OpenStreetMap, Esri) for improved visualization.
    Responsive Design: The application adapts to different screen sizes and devices for an optimal user experience.

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/wildlife-webgis.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

    cd wildlife-webgis

    Open the index.htm file in your web browser:

    You can open the index.htm file directly, or use a local server (e.g., Live Server in VSCode) to run the project.

Project Structure

    css/ - Contains the CSS files used for styling the application.
    data/ - Contains GeoJSON files that store geospatial data for wildlife tracking and habitats.
    icons/ - Contains custom icons used for markers on the map.
    js/ - Contains the JavaScript files, including the main script.js which handles the map logic and data processing.
    index.htm - The main HTML file that initializes the web application.

Usage

    Loading Wildlife Data: The application loads wildlife tracking data from the GeoJSON files located in the data/ directory.
    Interactive Markers: Clicking on a wildlife marker will display information such as the animal's ID, movement history, and the time of the last recorded location.
    Visualizing Routes: The routes taken by wildlife can be visualized on the map as lines, with interactive pop-ups showing route details.

Customization

    Updating GeoJSON Data:
        Update the GeoJSON files in the data/ folder to include new wildlife tracking data or modify existing data.
        Ensure that the properties in the GeoJSON files are consistent with the expected structure in script.js.

    Changing Map Icons:
        Custom icons for wildlife and routes can be added to the icons/ directory and referenced in script.js.

Future Enhancements

    Live Data Integration: Integrate real-time wildlife tracking data from external sources or sensors.
    Advanced Analytics: Add tools for analyzing wildlife movement patterns and predicting future movements.
    Enhanced UI/UX: Improve the user interface with additional interactive elements and visual enhancements.
